## Using a Kindle Screen to Monitor ESXi

This is a personal project to monitor a standalone ESXi host by displaying statistics on a Kindle.

To use this you'll need to populate a secrets.py file with your relavent ESXi information.  See imports for `update_kindle.py`, you'll likely need to edit this to your needs as well.
